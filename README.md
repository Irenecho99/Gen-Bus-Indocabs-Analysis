General Business 306 - Analysis of Cancellations at a Cab Portal Company

# Case Study:

IndoCabs is an Indian cab company that is managed by the independent drivers
and costumers. However, IndoCabs is facing a problem due to the drivers cancelling the
ride. IndoCabs executives believe that it is due to a poor algorithm and try to find a trend
between the data such as booking window, cancellation rate, customers booking trend,
and weekday usage of cabs.
